change code so that if the location is null it will
display a "holding" map.
        renderImage(imgSrc, artTitle, artMedium)
        if ( !( artLocation ) ){
            console.log( "Running initMap");
          resetMap();
        }
        else{
          console.log( "Running displayMap");
          displayMap(artLocation);
        }

displayMap function changes:
  data.results[0].address_components.short_name never returns anything.
  This used to set the value for the map marker. I changed it so that the
  incoming parameter LocationString (Gallery name) is now the map marker.

Other Problems I am seeing: (I did a git pull, but I don't think I have the
latest version of the code)
1. The left image does not diplay in my version when the carousel is populated.
2. When a new artist is entered the previous artist images aren't cleared
   until the carousel image is clicked.
3. There is no error handling for when no art is found for an artist (for
   example Salvador Dali or Andy Warhol).
